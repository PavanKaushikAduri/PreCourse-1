# Time Complexity :
#       append: O(n) - adding a new node at the end of the linked list.
#       find: O(n) - searching for a node with a specific key in the linked list.
#       remove: O(n) - removing a node with a specific key from the linked list.
# Space Complexity : O(N) - N is the number of elements in the linked list, each element is stored as a node in the linked list.

# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes

# Any problem you faced while coding : while removing the base case where prev is None is missed. i should check for prev is not None and if its None then self.head = current.next.
